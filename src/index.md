## Killer Features

- **Thin-client architecture**
  - delegate as much as possible to optional reusable utility package [eleventy-bricks](https://github.com/anydigital/eleventy-bricks)
  - import/symlink by default, but allow to copy and override as needed
  - no sample html/njk/css/js/etc. files -- just the bare essentials
- **One-click deployment to Netlify** (or any similar platform)
- **CMS included** ([sveltia-cms](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms))
- **Tailwind included** (with Typography plugin!)

## Why "Sveleven"?

"Sveleven" is simply a portmanteau of ["<mark>Sve</mark>ltia CMS"](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) and ["<mark>Eleven</mark>ty"](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) -- two great open-source projects that work together seamlessly.
